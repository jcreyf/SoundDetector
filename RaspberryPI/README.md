## JumpRopeCounter
Try to detect the sound of the rope hitting the floor and using that as a trigger to keep count of how many times you jumped since you started the app or pressed the `Reset` button.<br>
The app also allows to `Pause` counting in case you want to take a break or to pause in between sets.<br>
The app is listening for sounds, so you have to adjust the sensor to filter out as much ambient sound as possible and you obviously get the best result if you can direct the sensor to the spot on the floor where the rope is hitting.<br>
All by all, I think I'm getting close to 95% accuracy, which I call a "success!".  I don't need it to be precise.  Just want to get a close estimate.<br>
Counting in my head was getting just as exhausting as jumping the rope!  I can now jump much longer since I no longer need to count and who cares whether I jumped 950 times or 1050 times when the counter shows 1000!?  Breaking sweat is what I'm after...<br>
I can now finally listen to podcasts while jumping or enjoy the music more (sound needs to come through ear plugs though since the sound may interfere with the sound detection if it comes through speakers).
